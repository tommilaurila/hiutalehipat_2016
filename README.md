# hiutalehipat_2016
A snake game written in Python using the pygame libraries. The game idea is based on the sentdex (search on YouTube) Python tutorial. The code is heavily modified and optimized to get 30 fps on a Raspberry Pi model 1 overclocked to 900MHz.

The hardware also includes a self made, GPIO driven candy dispenser that dispenses candy based on your game score. 

This is still an ongoing project and more info will be posted..
